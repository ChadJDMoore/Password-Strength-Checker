# Password Strength Checker

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a Python script that evaluates the strength of a password based on predefined security criteria. This tool helps users understand how secure their passwords are and provides feedback to encourage stronger password practices.

### Skills Learned

- Regex (Regular Expressions): Learned to apply regex patterns to validate specific conditions like detecting uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Python Functions: Gained experience in defining and using reusable functions.
- Conditional Logic: Improved understanding of implementing conditional statements to determine outcomes based on criteria.
- User Input Handling: Practiced collecting user input and providing dynamic feedback.
  
### Tools Used

- Python 3.x: The primary programming language used to develop the script.
- Regex Module (re): Utilized to perform pattern matching for password validation.
- Command Line/Terminal: Used for testing and running the script interactively.

## Steps
#### 1. Import the re Module

- Import Python's built-in re module for regex functionality
